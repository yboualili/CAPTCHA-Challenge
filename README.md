CAPTCHA Image Classification Competition

This project was part of a competition focused on CAPTCHA image classification. The task was to correctly classify CAPTCHA images, which required denoising the data to improve the quality of the input images. I utilized multiple pretrained vision transformers (ViTs), adjusting for unbalanced class distributions by assigning different weights to each class. To further enhance the model's performance, I incorporated an LSTM as a meta-learner, using the output of all ViTs as input. I won the competition with an accuracy of 89.9% on the test set.
